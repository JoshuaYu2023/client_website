# Notes for thoughts and troubleshooting

* CMS: Should I make my own or try to use WordPress?
  * A CMS has two components, a CMA (content management application) used on the front end to allow an average joe to update and change things. It also used a CDA (content delivery application) to compile the content and update the website
  * I would have to create either a cloud based version (difficult on my own) or a server based version (also difficult).
  * I would propably benefit from creating it in tandem with WordPress, will research how to do this more.
